		<p>This is the competiton to win
		The people who loose are the biggest loser
		Because they stand below on the ground and see others
		rise becuase they believe they can't stand

			The rule to win a game is not to lose the game by a combination of sheer intelligence
			might and honor to let the world see that who is the ruler. Don't lose the self Respect
			for when you lose the self respect you lose a part of yourself and make your way for all
			the losses that happen in the life. It is the result of hard work and fine tune.On the other
			 hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized
