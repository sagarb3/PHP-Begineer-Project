			 Deepika Padukone will be making a special visit to her school for a fund raiser event.

Deepika was born and brought up in Bangalore and went to the prestigious Sophia High School. The ace actor got approached by her school a month ago and the faculty requested her to be part of the event. She had a brief conversation with the faculty where they shared details of the event.
The school has organised a big scale event for fund raising which will go towards building a new wing in the school. The school will also be expanding and providing better facilities and amenities to students. Deepika immediately confirmed her presence and requested her team to ensure her dates can be worked out as she was very keen to make time and visit her school.

She has been in the middle of a busy schedule as she is shooting for Piku, but she accommodated this on priority basis.
