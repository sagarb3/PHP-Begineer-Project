			The rule to win a game is not to lose the game by a combination of sheer intelligence
			might and honor to let the world see that who is the ruler.
			In previous example we have selected a priority of 9 for our filter, so to skip any other logic either placed in
custom or core filters such as CakePHP internal routing system. Although it is not required, it shows how to
make your important code run first in case you need to trim as much fat as possible from some requests.
For obvious reasons this has the potential of making your app very difficult to maintain. Filters are an
extremely powerful tool when used wisely, adding response handlers for each URL in your app is not a
good use for it. But if you got a valid reason to do so, then you have a clean solution at hand. Keep in mind
that not everything needs to be a filter, Controllers and Components are usually a more accurate choice for
adding any request handling code to your app.
